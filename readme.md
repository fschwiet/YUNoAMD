Next steps:
  need to provide more C# methods to javascript... to implement a .\YUNoAMD\requireJS\build\jslib\YUNoAMD\
    print.js -> done-ish
	optimize.js =>  use node's...  we can optimize in post-processing
	load.js -> done-ish
	file.js ->  aggh
	args.js -> agh

Jurassic limitations:
  don't see a way to hook up functions with variable # of arguments
  
  don't see a way to control the context of execution (faking this wrapping in function(){})
